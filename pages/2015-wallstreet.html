      <p>2015 was a year of doing whatever I wanted. I was back and forth between California and Florida as I pleased. Saw Texas and New Mexico as well.</p>
      <p>I learned the Effiel Tower looks better in the time but the food surrounding it dissapointing. Jamaica became the most beautiful place my eyes have ever seen...but the Four Seasons in Ko Samui beats the Waldorf in Manhattan by a mile.</p>
      <p>I managed to snag an internship on Broad Street at boutique Investment Bank and Retail Brokerage. I learned a lot of from my senior brokers. The first thing was...rich people do take the subway. The second was if I have the opportunity to go to thailand...go. The third was that I was horrible at closing but I had what it took to make on the Street. What I learned about myself was that I could wake up at 4am to get on the train from Poughkeepsie to be at my internship at 7am, work until 5pm, take a Calc II course in six weeks and get an -A. My work ethich was undeniable but my love for sales was being revealed to me.</p>
